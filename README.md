# Message-In-A-Bottle

### About
    * Message in a Bottle is a simple full-stack application that allows the user to write messages and populate the ocean with bottles containing these messages
    * The ocean will have no more than 5 bottles, and the messages in the bottles will be randomly selected from the database if the user sends more than 5 messages
    * Technologies used: Express, Sequelize, Handlebars, SimplexNoise, and SpeechSynthesisUtterance

### How to Use
    * Type in a message into the form on the top-left corner
    * Once finished with the message, click "Release the Bottle!"
    * You will see a bottle appear on the screen (if not, be sure to zoom out because the application was designed for 1920 x 1080 resolution)
    * Click on the bottle, and you will see a "scroll" appear on the screen
    * Click on the "scroll" and your message will unravel, along with an automated voice that will read your message
    * Repeat as many times as you like, and be sure to note that your messages will be randomized once you send over 5 messages
    * Last but not least, be sure to click "play" in the top-right corner to hear some serene hip-hop while you write your message!
